    <string name="question_one">What is Substratum?</string>
    <string name="answer_one">Substratum is an app that takes advantage of Sony\'s Overlay Manager
        Service (OMS). This is similar to Layers in terms of stability and customization (as it
        builds off RRO) but features such things as no reboots to apply, boot animations, fonts and
        priority switching.

    <string name="question_five">How do I apply a theme?</string>
    <string name="answer_five">The application of a theme is a two part process: compilation of the
        overlays and application of the overlays. Go into the theme, click the Overlay Manager tab, select the overlays and options you
        want, hit the FAB and choose Compile/Update, then chose those same overlays, and hit the FAB
        and choose Enable Selected.
    </string>

    <string name="question_eight">I\'m bootlooping! How do I fix it?</string>
    <string name="answer_eight">Substratum has it\'s own recovery system called Substratum Rescue
        System (SRS), which is an automated system that dumps an archive into
        /storage/emulated/0/substratum/SubstratumRescue.zip. Flash this ZIP in recovery and reboot!
    </string>

    <string name="question_nine">Some elements look janky after I applied a theme, what happened?</string>
    <string name="answer_nine">
        1. Restart SystemUI if it didn\'t do so automatically.\n2. Reboot the phone.\n3. Disable
        the overlays, recompile, and reenable.
    </string>

    <string name="question_twelve">Who do I contact if I have a serious issue not resolved by reading these steps?</string>
    <string name="answer_twelve">Please make a post in the Substratum Google+ community. Please provide
        the following information: Substratum version, ROM, theme (if issues applying one), and, if
        possible, a logcat.
