# substratum development branch [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/nicholaschum/substratum.svg?branch=dev)](https://travis-ci.org/nicholaschum/substratum)
A new overlaying manager based off Sony's OverlayManagerService. This is the official repository of the substratum theme engine.

# masquerade
Masquerade is Substratum's background service that runs functions that should run on a completely separate process. This alleviates the stress on the main app of Substratum and allows it to run more smoothly.
